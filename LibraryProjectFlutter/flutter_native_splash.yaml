# !! IMPORTANT !!
# after updating this config ALWAYS run the command "dart run flutter_native_splash:create --path=flutter_native_splash.yaml" as per documentation
# also, I believe running that command removes the android:screenOrientation="portrait" from android/app/src/mainAndroidManifest.xml
# so make sure its still there after running that command

  # Following are specific parameters for Android 12+.
  android_12:
    # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.  If this parameter is not specified,
    # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
    # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
    # App icon with an icon background: This should be 960×960 pixels, and fit within a circle
    # 640 pixels in diameter.
    # App icon without an icon background: This should be 1152×1152 pixels, and fit within a circle
    # 768 pixels in diameter.  To fit a 1152x1152 image within a circle with a 768 diameter, simply 
    # ensure that the most important design elements of your image are placed within a circular area
    # with a 768 diameter at the center of the 1152x1152 canvas.

    # The image_dark, color_dark, icon_background_color_dark, and branding_dark set values that

    # parameters from above.  If there is no parameter above, the app will use the light mode values.
